### What is the app idea? 
I love playing memory games, some of them can be addicting too. I'm creating this memory game using Svelte, players will be presented with a grid of face-down cards, and they must flip over pairs of cards to find matching pairs. The objective is to match all pairs within a time limit.

### List at least 15 application requirements for the front end 
1. Players will be presented with a grid of face-down cards on the game board.
2. These cards are random and different in each game.\
3. Players can flip 2 cards each time.
4. If the 2 cards match, they stay facing up.
5. If the 2 cards don't match, they will down back down.
6. A game timer showing on the screen. Players need to find all the matches within the time limit.
7. Players can pick the difficulty level, the harder the less time they have.
8. If the player cannot find all the matches, the game will be over.
9. When the game is over (either win or not), the players will be sent back to pick difficulty level.
10. Winng and losing message will be shown on screen when game is over.
11. Players will be presented with a new game board, and the timer will reset.
12. Matched emoji will be shown on the screen
13. Card flipping animation.
14. Auto play and loop background music when game starts.
15. Matching sound effect when 2 cards matched.

### What tool or framework will you use and why?
I'm Svelte to create this Memory game because I feel most comfortable with Svelte. In addition, I like using Skeleton and Tailwind with it, they make UI design so much easier!

### Why is this project worth your final project?
I think it will be fun and challenging to create this Memory game. In addition, I always like games that will engage my brain, that's why I think a memory game will be a good choice.
